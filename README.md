# Pollen Cookbook

This is a book of how-to recipes for publishing with [Pollen][1].

It is a work in progress: I am writing it in tandem with “Pollen Time” sessions: live streaming
events where I take questions and demonstrate techniques.

You can sign up to [the Pollen Time email newsletter][2] to be notified about upcoming Pollen Time
events.

You’ll get the most use out of this book (and the online events) if you have already completed the
excellent tutorials in [Pollen’s main documentation][1].

The book is currently not yet live anywhere on the web. If you have Pollen installed you can clone
this repo and run `raco pollen start -l` to see it in your web browser on your local machine.
